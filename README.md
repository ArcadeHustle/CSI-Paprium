# CSI: Paprium (Forensic Sprite analysis) 

It is time to go [CSI Cyber](https://twitter.com/csicyber) on the [Paprium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CTqTzkgZQ) artwork by [Watermelongames](https://www.magicalgamefactory.com).<br>

This repo will examine the "fair use(?)", or "inspiration" in historic games as reimagined by Paprium artists: [Tori](https://twitter.com/toribirdnosu), [Tim Jonsson](https://twitter.com/Tim__Jonsson), [Luis Martins](https://twitter.com/XLuis__MartinsX), [Gwenael Godde](https://twitter.com/watermelongames)(Fonzie), [Andrew Bado](https://twitter.com/DarkFalzXL), [Piotr Radecki](http://www.twitter.com/guitarpiter), (deceased?)[Shane Stevens](https://twitter.com/Pixelgeddon), and unnamed ["chinese animators" that were "contracted by Fonzie"](https://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?35377-Paprium-The-Official-Thread-Mk-2&p=838535&viewfull=1#post838535).<br>

As CodieKitty put it ["The lines between reference and inspiration, and swiping and plagiarism can be murky"](https://codiekitty.com/MOREC/wmswiping.htm). This will be an educational trip into "Fair Use" and DMCA exemptions in which we will [criticize, research, and comment on](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html) claims that Watermelon games "stole" sprites from other games. In the process some techniques will be taught for identifying stolen works.<br>

Please submit new "evidence" through the [Issues page](https://github.com/ArcadeHustle/CSI-Paprium/issues).<br>

Accepted issues will be added to this information tome via Pull [Requests](https://github.com/ArcadeHustle/CSI-Paprium/pulls).<br>

# Example Submissions
There has been a long raging debate about how much of the Paprium content is "stolen", vs an "homage", or "inspired by" other games. There is now plenty of animation data to examine to academically determine if there is any truth to this claim. Oddly enough Kenshiro vs Stalone is often cited by Paprium art director Luis Martins as a landmark example of inspiration vs piracy.<br>

Per fair use guidelines the animation frames, and sprites below are shared for the purposes of ["such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research"](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html).<br>

Without question Luis Martins own words frame the discussion on theft vs inspiration: ["Most of the character designs inspiration came from watching all kinds of cyberpunk anime and from playing tons of great beat em ups from the 90â€™s"](https://www.arcadeattack.co.uk/luis-martins-paprium/).

In tweets that have now been [deleted](https://twitter.com/arcade_projects/status/1452109564170706945) Luis openly stated that "a animator" before him was responsible for the Paprium artwork, and he only touched it up.<br>

It is not up for debate, that the Paprium art has a long murky history. The question is how murky.<br>

["To be clear, initially some chinese animators where contracted by Fonzie, then it became clear that that quality wasn't there, so we hired proper animators"](https://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?35377-Paprium-The-Official-Thread-Mk-2&p=838535&viewfull=1#post838535) - XGoldenboyX<br> 

"Animation & pixel art quality no less than: Final Fight (arcade), Street Of Rage 3 (megadrive / genesis), King Of Fighter (neo geo)."
