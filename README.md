# CSI: Paprium (Forensic Sprite analysis) 

It is time to go [CSI Cyber](https://twitter.com/csicyber) on the [Paprium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3CTqTzkgZQ) artwork by [Watermelongames](https://www.magicalgamefactory.com).<br>

This repo will examine the "fair use(?)", or "inspiration" in historic games as reimagined by Paprium artists: [Tori](https://twitter.com/toribirdnosu), [Tim Jonsson](https://twitter.com/Tim__Jonsson), [Luis Martins](https://twitter.com/XLuis__MartinsX), [Gwenael Godde](https://twitter.com/watermelongames)(Fonzie), and unnamed ["chinese animators" that were "contracted by Fonzie"](https://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?35377-Paprium-The-Official-Thread-Mk-2&p=838535&viewfull=1#post838535).<br>

As CodieKitty put it ["The lines between reference and inspiration, and swiping and plagiarism can be murky"](https://codiekitty.com/MOREC/wmswiping.htm). This will be an educational trip into "Fair Use" and DMCA exemptions in which we will [criticize, research, and comment on](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html) claims that Watermelon games "stole" sprites from other games. In the process some techniques will be taught for identifying stolen works.<br>

# Example Submissions
There has been a long raging debate about how much of the Paprium content is "stolen", vs an "homage", or "inspired by" other games. There is now plenty of animation data to examine to academically determine if there is any truth to this claim. Oddly enough Kenshiro vs Stalone is often cited by Paprium art director Luis Martins as a landmark example of inspiration vs piracy.<br>

Per fair use guidelines the animation frames, and sprites below are shared for the purposes of ["such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research"](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html).<br>

Without question Luis Martins words frame the discussion: "Most of the character designs inspiration came from watching all kinds of cyberpunk anime and from playing tons of great beat em ups from the 90’s."<br>

In tweets that have now been deleted Luis stated that "a animator" before him was responsible for the Paprium artwork, and he only touched it up.<br>

["To be clear, initially some chinese animators where contracted by Fonzie, then it became clear that that quality wasn't there, so we hired proper animators"](https://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?35377-Paprium-The-Official-Thread-Mk-2&p=838535&viewfull=1#post838535) - XGoldenboyX<br>
